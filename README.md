# Hugo Overflow Identity Example Site

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/0f92221c-7181-489d-8309-fcccc0a9fac7/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/hugo-overflow-identity/deploys)

This is an example site for the [Hugo Overflow Identity theme](https://github.com/setu4993/hugo-overflow-identity).

It is the same as the one [in the `exampleSite` directory](https://github.com/setu4993/hugo-overflow-identity/tree/main/exampleSite), just hosted separately to make it easy to deploy it [with Netlify](https://hugo-overflow-identity.netlify.app).
